🚫 Cellar Is Now on Indefinite Hiatus

Hey everyone — Delta here.
So… after thinking things through (a LOT), I’ve decided to put Cellar on an indefinite hiatus.

Before anyone panics:
No, the project isn’t “dead.”
No, the repo isn’t going anywhere.
And yes, it’s still GPLv3 because I’m not a monster.

Cellar started as a fun idea — “the attic/cellar of the internet,” a place to stash massive drive backups during OS migrations. And honestly? I still love that vision.

But right now, for safety reasons and general sanity, I need to pause development and step back to rethink how this thing should work long-term.

What this means:

⚠️ No new updates for a while.

🧊 The repo stays up, untouched and open-source.

🧠 I’m giving myself room to redesign the concept safely.

📌 Future updates will be announced if/when they happen.

I’m not quitting programming. I’m not abandoning the idea forever.
I’m just being smart and not rushing something that needs more planning than I originally thought.

Thanks to anyone who ever glanced at this project, starred it, or thought,
“Hey, this kid might be onto something.”
Y’all are cool.

Stay tuned… maybe. 😄

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome!
If you’re planning something major, open an issue first so I don’t think the repo got nuked.
Make sure to update tests and docs. Future Delta84 appreciates it.

## What is Cellar?
Cellar is a (prototype) self-hosted cloud storage app written in Python + Tkinter.
(Yes, it will eventually be rewritten in Java or C++. If you contribute in those languages, put the code in THIS repository so things don’t get messy.)

Right now, Cellar includes:
- Login GUI
- Account creation
- Standalone Windows executable build

Future roadmap:
- File upload/download
- Replication across independent servers
- Entropy-based encryption (yes, we’re using lava lamps — Cloudflare did it first, we’re just cooler)
- Hardened Debian server deployment
- Rewriting Python into a Real Programming Language (C++ or another PGL)

---

## Feature Checklist
[x] Login GUI with account creation
[x] Windows build script with PyInstaller
[ ] Rewrite in C++ or another PGL
[ ] File upload/download
[ ] Multi-server replication
[ ] Entropy-based encryption
[ ] Debian hardened server deployment

## Current Requirements (THIS WILL CHANGE!!)
- Python
- tkinter
- pillow

---

## Install Guide
1. Run the PS1 file:
   build-windows.ps1
2. Say Y to the prompt
3. Wait
4. Done — your EXE is located at:
   C:\Users\user\directory\Cellar_V\dist\Cellar.exe

---

## What the build script does
- Upgrades pip
- Installs dependencies (Pillow, PyInstaller)
- Runs PyInstaller to package the app into a standalone Windows executable
- Embeds the icon (cellar.ico)
- Outputs to:
  dist\Cellar.exe

---

## Run in Dev Mode
To run the app without building an EXE:

python cellar_python_win64.py

---

## Post-Build Notes
- If you pinned an older EXE to the taskbar, unpin it first before pinning the new one
- Icon still blurry? Restart Windows Explorer or reboot
- Antivirus warnings are normal for unsigned EXEs — code signing helps avoid them

## PyInstaller Notes
Missing modules at runtime? Add them to:

hiddenimports=[...]

Need to include extra files? Add them under:

datas=[...]

Force a clean rebuild:

python -m PyInstaller --clean Cellar.spec
